#Overview

This project aims to predict whether a customer will purchase additional health insurance products based on their existing insurance policies and demographic information.

##Dataset
The dataset contains the following information:

-Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
-Age: Age of the customer.
-Gender: Gender of the customer.
Driving License: Indicates whether the customer has a driving license.
Vehicle Owned: Indicates whether the customer owns a vehicle.
Vehicle Insurance: Indicates whether the customer has vehicle insurance.
Policy Tenure: Duration of the customer's existing policy (in years).
Premium: Premium amount of the customer's existing policy.
Claim: Indicates whether the customer has filed a claim in the past.
Claim Amount: Amount of the claim filed by the customer (if applicable).
Response: Target variable indicating whether the customer purchased additional health insurance (1) or not (0).
Methodology
Data Exploration:

Analyze the dataset for missing values, outliers, and data distributions.
Visualize the data to understand relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary to improve model performance.
Handle categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
Model Selection:

Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) to find the most suitable model for the task.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model on the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using the chosen metrics.
Fine-tune the model if necessary.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict whether new customers are likely to purchase additional health insurance.
Code Structure
The project code is organized into the following directories:

data: Contains the dataset.
src: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
models: Stores trained models.

Additional Notes
Consider using techniques like cross-validation to assess model performance more reliably.
Explore feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to the prediction.
Implement a deployment pipeline to integrate the model into a production environment.
